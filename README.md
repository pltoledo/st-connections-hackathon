This app is my submission to [Streamlit Connections Hackathon](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/connections-hackathon/47574), in which I was fortunate to be one of the winners! You can find the deployed app at [https://pltoledo-st-connections-hackathon.streamlit.app/](https://pltoledo-st-connections-hackathon.streamlit.app/)!

The code is open for use, feel free to use and build upon it as you may.
